# Learn-React-fast
Are you an impatient learner like me? This is the React tutorial for you.

# Before we start...
Iâ€™m writing this because of two reasons: The first is to ensure I know React so well that I can write a tutorial. The second is that I consider most tutorials to be very slow and I like going fast and straight to action, so here you will see little text just to know what is going on.

# Introduction
React.js is an Open Source library developed by Facebook Developers, for building User Interfaces (UI). React makes user interfaces very easy to build by cutting each page into pieces. We call these pieces **components**.
